I have been messing around with zip bombs since I saw a screenshot of a 55.6 YottaByte zip bomb. I believe I have made a 1,129,592,419,600 YB zip bomb, 
around 1,129,592,419,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Bytes or 1.1 sextillion bytes. I don't know if this is even possible to put inside a zip file
or if it even works.
